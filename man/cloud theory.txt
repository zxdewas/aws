 1.edge location in aws.
In AWS (Amazon Web Services), an edge location refers to a data center facility that is part of the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN). Edge locations are strategically located around the world to ensure low-latency content delivery to end users.

The primary purpose of edge locations is to cache and distribute content closer to end users, reducing the time it takes for data to travel from the origin server to the user's location. When a user requests content, CloudFront delivers it from the edge location that provides the lowest latency and best performance for that user.
Edge locations are not the same as AWS Regions or Availability Zones. AWS Regions are separate geographic areas with multiple Availability Zones, each consisting of one or more data centers. Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other but connected through low-latency links. Edge locations, on the other hand, are located in various cities and are designed to cache and deliver content quickly.

It's important to note that the number of edge locations can change over time as AWS continues to expand its global infrastructure to improve content delivery performance. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, AWS had over 225 edge locations worldwide. For an up-to-date and detailed list of current edge locations, I recommend referring to the official AWS documentation or contacting AWS support.
