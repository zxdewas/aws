it easier to follow the lab steps.
Task 1: Create Your VPC
In this task, you will use the VPC and more option in the VPC console to create multiple
resources, including a VPC, an Internet Gateway, a public subnet and a private subnet
in a single Availability Zone, two route tables, and a NAT Gateway.

5. In the search box to the right of Services, search for and choose VPC to open the VPC
console.
6. Begin creating a VPC.
o In the top left of the screen, verify the New VPC Experience is toggled on. If it is not,
toogle it on now.
o Choose the VPC dashboard link which is also towards the top left of the console.
o Next, choose Create VPC.
7. Configure the VPC details in the VPC settings panel on the left:
o Choose VPC and more.
o Under Name tag auto-generation, keep Auto-generate selected, however change the
value from project to lab.
o Keep the IPv4 CIDR block set to 10.0.0.0/16
o For Number of Availability Zones, choose 1.
o For Number of public subnets, keep the 1 setting.
o For Number of private subnets, keep the 1 setting.
o Expand the Customize subnets CIDR blocks section
 Change Public subnet CIDR block in us-east-1a to 10.0.0.0/24
 Change Private subnet CIDR block in us-east-1a to 10.0.1.0/24
o Set NAT gateways to In 1 AZ.
o Set VPC endpoints to None.
o Keep both DNS hostnames and DNS resolution enabled.

8. In the Preview panel on the right, confirm the settings you have configured.
o VPC: lab-vpc
o Subnets:
 us-east-1a
 Public subnet name: lab-subnet-public1-us-east-1a
 Private subnet name: lab-subnet-private1-us-east-1a
o Route tables
 lab-rtb-public
 lab-rtb-private1-us-east-1a
o Network connections
 lab-igw
 lab-nat-public1-us-east-1a

9. At the bottom of the screen, choose Create VPC
10.Once it is complete, choose View VPC
11.In the left navigation pane, choose Subnets.
12.Choose Create subnet then configure:
o VPC ID: lab-vpc (select from the menu).
o Subnet name: lab-subnet-public2
o Availability Zone: Select the second Availability Zone (for example, us-east-1b)
o IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.2.0/24
13.Choose Create subnet
14.Choose Create subnet then configure:
o VPC ID: lab-vpc
o Subnet name: lab-subnet-private2
o Availability Zone: Select the second Availability Zone (for example, us-east-1b)
o IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.3.0/24
15.Choose Create subnet
16.In the left navigation pane, choose Route tables.
17.Select the lab-rtb-private1-us-east-1a route table.
18.In the lower pane, choose the Routes tab.
19.Choose the Subnet associations tab.
20.Choose Edit subnet associations
21.Leave lab-subnet-private1-us-east-1a selected, but also select lab-subnet-private2.
22.Choose Save associations
23.Select the lab-rtb-public route table (and deselect any other subnets).
24.In the lower pane, choose the Routes tab.
25.Choose the Subnet associations tab.
26.Choose Edit subnet associations
27.Leave lab-subnet-public1-us-east-1a selected, but also select lab-subnet-public2.
28.Choose Save associations
29.In the left navigation pane, choose Security groups.
30.Choose Create security group and then configure:
o Security group name: Web Security Group
o Description: Enable HTTP access
o VPC: choose the X to remove the currently selected VPC, then from the drop down list
choose lab-vpc
31.In the Inbound rules pane, choose Add rule
32.Configure the following settings:
o Type: HTTP
o Source: Anywhere-IPv4
o Description: Permit web requests
33.Scroll to the bottom of the page and choose Create security group
34.In the search box to the right of Services, search for and choose EC2 to open the EC2
console.

35.From the Launch instance menu choose Launch instance.

36.Name the instance:
o Give it the name Web Server 1
When you name your instance, AWS creates a tag and associates it with the instance.
A tag is a key value pair. The key for this pair is *Name*, and the value is the name you
enter for your EC2 instance.

37.Choose an AMI from which to create the instance:
o In the list of available Quick Start AMIs, keep the default Amazon Linux AMI selected.
o Also keep the default Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) selected.
The type of Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you choose determines the Operating
System that will run on the EC2 instance that you launch.

38.Choose an Instance type:
o In the Instance type panel, keep the default t2.micro selected.
The Instance Type defines the hardware resources assigned to the instance.
39.Select the key pair to associate with the instance:
o From the Key pair name menu, select vockey.
The vockey key pair you selected will allow you to connect to this instance via SSH after
it has launched. Although you will not need to do that in this lab, it is still required to
identify an existing key pair, or create a new one, when you launch an instance.
40.Configure the Network settings:
o Next to Network settings, choose Edit, then configure:
 Network: lab-vpc
 Subnet: lab-subnet-public2 (not Private!)
 Auto-assign public IP: Enable
o Next, you will configure the instance to use the Web Security Group that you created
earlier.
 Under Firewall (security groups), choose Select an existing security group.
 For Common security groups, select Web Security Group.
This security group will permit HTTP access to the instance.
41.In the Configure storage section, keep the default settings.
42.Configure a script to run on the instance when it launches:
o Expand the Advanced details panel.
o Scroll to the bottom of the page and then copy and paste the code shown below into the
User data box:
#!/bin/bash
# Install Apache Web Server and PHP
yum install -y httpd mysql php
# Download Lab files
wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/CUR-TF-100-ACCLFO-2/2-lab2-vpc/s3/lab-app.zip
unzip lab-app.zip -d /var/www/html/
# Turn on web server
chkconfig httpd on
service httpd start
43.At the bottom of the Summary panel on the right side of the screen choose Launch
instance
44.Choose View all instances
45.Wait until Web Server 1 shows 2/2 checks passed in the Status check column.
46.Select Web Server 1.
47.Copy the Public IPv4 DNS value shown in the Details tab at the bottom of the page.
48.Open a new web browser tab, paste the Public DNS value and press Enter.
49.Choose End Lab at the top of this page and then choose Yes to confirm that you want
to end the lab.
A panel will appear, indicating that "DELETE has been initiated... You may close this
message box now."
50.Choose the X in the top right corner to close the panel.
